# Bibel

Alkitab bahasa Batak Toba.

Clone this project and run these following commands to try locally:

```bash
cd bibel
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Note!

Apparently, this app takes a lot of usage data and caching data is the best way to reduce it but somehow it broke if you try to deloy it to a serverless cloud such as Vercel so you have to use your own server.

*This is just a fun project!*
